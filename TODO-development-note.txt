ToDo items on specnorm:

-> find a new keybinding for fitting the data that is not a matplotlib default binding.

-> add some sort of realtime'ish logging capabilities.



Matplotlib development notes:
- if your making keybindings for your matplotlib app and one of them corresponds to a matplotlib keybinding, matplotlib will steal
the event and then pass it through to mpl_connect.

- nifty keys, 
    - g turns the grid on and off.
